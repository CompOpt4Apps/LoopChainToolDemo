# Build/Use Assistance Scripts
This project has some difficult dependencies to satisfy.
There are two ways to avoid solving this problem yourself:
1. Use the scripts in the directory `local_build_generator` to automatically
   download and build the dependencies. Depending on your system this may or
   may-not work.
   This simplifies the dependency build process to:
   ```
   ./generate_local_build.sh; # While under ./local_build_generator
   ./build.sh; # While under ./build_dir, which is generated by the previous script
   ```
   However the build may fail due to environmental differences.
   See the Readme for details.
2. Use the scripts in the directory `docker_container` to create a docker
   container that will wrap the LoopChainToolDemo executable. Because the docker
   container is a sanitized and highly controlled environment, there is a very
   high probability that it will successfully build the dependencies and the
   LoopChainToolDemo executable. The trade-off is that running docker in any way
   requires root access, and the tools becomes slightly less accessible.
   This simplifies the entire process (dependency build and demo tool build) to:
   ```
   sudo ./make_image.sh; # While under docker_container. docker requires root
   ```
   and running becomes:
   ```
   cat path/to/source/file.cpp | sudo docker run -i compopt4apps/loopchaintooldemo > path/to/output/file.cpp
   ```
